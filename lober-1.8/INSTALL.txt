LOBE DYNAMICS PACKAGE - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------

*A***FIRST, INSTALL LIBISINSIDE 2.x or above
  starting with lober1.8, libisInside2.x is required during installation and run-time. libisInside can be downloaded at http://www.lekien.com/~francois/software/libisInside

*B***MAKE SURE THAT THE HEADER AND EXEC OF LIBISINSIDE ARE ACCESSIBLE
  If libisInside was installed system-wide by an administrator, that should not be a problem. libisInside is installed by default in /usr/local. Hence the header file is in /usr/local/include and the library is in /usr/local/lib. Some systems do not check /usr/local/lib automatically and requires adding "/usr/local/lib" to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to run properly.
  If libisInside was installed by a user in his home directory, some adjustment must be made to compile lober:
     1) The compiler must be able to find the include file: you can do this by adding "/home/login/include" to CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH. Some systems may use C_INCLUDE_PATH or GCC_INCLUDE_PATH. I rum bash and use:
     export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/home/lekien/include
If you use csh, tcsh, "man setenv" and set the variables to what they have to be.
     2) The linker must be able to find the library at link time. I do this by adding "/home/login/lib" to the env. variable LIBRARY_PATH
     3) After that, everything should compile and link properly. You may want to add "/home/login/lib" to LD_LIBRARY_PATH too. lober will not run if the path to libisInside is not listed in one of the LD paths.
  Notice that, since you are installing programs, libraries and headers in your home directory, you should really make these changes to the environment variables in the appropriate configuration file: .cshrc, .bashrc. At least, you should have a "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/login/lib" and a "export PATH=$PATH:/home/login/bin" so you do not have to set that variable each time you run lober.

*C***FIRST CHECK THAT EVERYTHING COMPILES PROPERLY
  tar -xzf lober1.8.tgz
  cd lober1.8
  ./configure
  make

If you have root access, go to D, otherwise go to E.

*D***THEN INSTALL IN PROPER DIRECTORY
for system-wide installation:
  su
  <type root password>
  make install
  make install-strip
That should install everything in /usr/local/bin. You can change the target directory by typing 
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/otherplace

*E***THEN INSTALL IN USER DIRECTORY
  ./configure --prefix=/home/username
  make install
  make install-strip
That should install everything in /home/username/bin/ and set all the paths correctly. You can change the target directory by typing 
  ./configure --prefix=/home/username/myprefferedloberdirectory/subdir
Notice that the installation of lober will put files in two directories:
       /install-root/bin/ lober itself and some utilities
       /install-root/man/ man pages

*F***TO CLEAN EXECUTABLE AND CREATE FRESH COPIES
  make clean

*G***TO UNINSTALL
  make uninstall
  (make sure that you ./configure --prefix= with the right prefix before
